Key Takeaways

    AI can’t replace you as a podcaster, but it can cut your workload in half.
    The right AI prompts help you plan faster, promote smarter, and repurpose better, without losing your voice.
    Riverside’s Co-Creator is a powerful AI assistant specifically tailored for podcasters that will let you edit and repurpose your content just by chatting.

If you’re a podcaster who wants to speed up your workflow, these AI podcasting prompts can save you hours. 

From scripting, guest outreach, and podcast promotion, here is a full list of ready-to-use podcast prompts to try.
What can you do with AI & ChatGPT podcasting prompts?

Not sure where to start? You can use ChatGPT and AI for many purposes, including automating tedious tasks, breaking through creative blocks, and improving your outreach.

We’ve organized 45 podcast-ready prompts into clear categories so you can choose how to integrate AI in your podcasting workflows:

    Podcast brainstorming and naming
    Guest outreach and interviews
    Episode scripting and outlines
    Audience engagement and community building
    Editing your podcast
    Publishing and distribution
    Promotion across platforms
    Repurposing and short-form content
    Sponsor pitches and media kits

And yes, we know. ChatGPT is great with words. But it won’t edit your episode, and post-production can be very time-consuming. That’s why we’ve also included prompts for Co-Creator: Riverside’s built in AI agent. 

It’s part of your Riverside dashboard and works directly with your recordings. All without needing to re-upload them or a transcript, and sometimes without even typing a full prompt. 

Still skeptical? Here’s exactly how it works in practice, step by step:
Quick tutorial: How to access Co-Creator

Log in to your dashboard and from your Projects page, choose the video you want to edit. Click on the “Edit” button right below the video to get inside the Editor.

Click on the “Co-Creator” button on the upper right corner to open Co-Creator. 
Accessing co-creator from Riverside's editor

From now on, all you need to do is literally tell it what you want, like “edit this into an Instagram Reel” or “add B-roll,” and Co-Creator will make the edits for you.

You can also click on the “Suggestion” button to open a box with many different options.

Now, let’s get onto our prompts:
Co-creator and ChatGPT prompts for podcast brainstorming

The first steps can be the hardest ones, and staring at a blank page can be quite intimidating. Using ChatGPT and AI helps me a lot during brainstorming, both when launching a new show and in planning new episodes. 

Here are some prompts to help you at this stage:
1. Discovering niches

Prompt: Act as a podcast strategist. My podcast is about [insert topic]. My target audience is [insert demographics and audience description]. Generate 5 potential niche topics that are underserved but have high audience interest. For each niche, describe the ideal listener persona in detail, including their pain points, goals, and what they look for in a podcast.

AI podcast prompts for guest outreach

Interviewing the right guest can help you grow your audience. But finding the right person, reaching out, and securing a spot often takes time.

These prompts smooth out the process and help you craft personalized outreach that gets results:

AI prompts for podcast scripting

A script keeps you on track, especially if you use a teleprompter.

But overusing AI to write your episode scripts can make you lose credibility. ChatGPT speed ups the writing process. But if you let it write everything, you will quickly lose your voice.

Use AI to draft outlines, scripts, interview questions, and even ad reads, then rewrite in your style. Think of these prompts as a fast first pass, not the final cut.

And while ChatGPT does a decent job, consider using a dedicated AI script generator like ours. You’ll get precise scripts and outlines tailored to your voice without the need to create clever prompts. Plus, you’ll get guest suggestions.

AI prompts for audience engagement and community building

After the episode ends and you’re over talking at your audience, it’s time to start talking with your audience by building a community.

FAQs on Co-creator and ChatGPT podcast prompts
Can AI help me write a full podcast script?

Yes, AI can generate a full script, especially if it’s trained specifically to generate podcast scripts like Riverside’s one. AI-generated scripts can help you as first drafts and are a great way to save time putting your thoughts into words.

But, your unique voice and expert perspective are what make your show special. Always go back and rewrite them in your voice so the final script sounds authentically you.
What is chat-based editing? 

Chat-based editing is a new way to edit video and audio by telling your personal AI assistant what to do in natural language. 

In Riverside, you can simply tell Co-Creator what edits you want it to make, like “remove all the filler words” or “add my brand logo,” and it will do the work for you. This way, AI will do all the heavy lifting, so you can focus on the part you love.
How do podcasters use AI for promotion and marketing?

Many podcasters use AI to streamline nearly every aspect of promotion. Draft SEO-optimized titles or turn episodes into blog posts, social media assets, and emails with a few prompts. 

You can also use AI tools like Magic Clips or Co-Creator to generate ready-to-post video clips and trailers from long-form recordings.
Is it better to use ChatGPT directly or dedicated tools?

Why choose when you can use both? 

ChatGPT and the other LLMs are great all-purpose tools for brainstorming, research, and writing. But, dedicated tools like Riverside’s Co-creator can handle different production tasks like editing that ChatGPT simply can’t (it’s a chat, after all). 

In other words, pair them. Draft with ChatGPT, polish and publish faster with Co-Creator.
Can ChatGPT help me repurpose podcast content into clips or social posts?

Kind of, but it will take some manual work. ChatGPT can help you identify potential clips by analyzing a transcript, then draft captions for social posts. But you’ll still need to jump into your editor, find those sections, and cut/trim them yourself.

Co-Creator, instead, understands the context of your media so there’s no need to constantly copy, paste, and switch between different apps. You can simply ask it to make a reel about a given topic, and it will automatically find it in your content and prepare it for you.
